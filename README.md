# PySolFC-deals

The impossible and intractable 4-freecells and 5-freecells deals in
[PySol FC](https://pysolfc.sourceforge.io/)â€™s Range of
Deals - from 1 to 1,000,000,000 (= `10**9`), where the first 32,000
deals are compatible with
[Microsoft FreeCell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FreeCell).

These lists are based on the efforts of Theodore Pringle.
